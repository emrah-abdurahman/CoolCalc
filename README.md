# CoolCalc

A novelty online calculator to put my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into use.

## To-Do List:

- Add a limit to the number of digits we can place in the display to prevent overflow
- Fix bug where numbers don't register initially but work after clicking on the "C" button
- Add basic arithmetic functionality to the operator buttons
