# CoolCalc

A novelty online calculator to put my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into use.

## To-Do List:

**Items I am currently working on appear at the top with an exclamation mark next to them. Completed items appear at the bottom with a green tick next to them**

- :heavy_exclamation_mark: Add a limit to the number of digits we can place in the display to prevent overflow
- :heavy_exclamation_mark: Add basic arithmetic functionality to the operator buttons
- :heavy_check_mark: Fix bug where numbers don't register initially but work after clicking on the "C" button
